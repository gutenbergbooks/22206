    <h2>
      CHAPTER I.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The market-place at Trieste lay in a blaze of colour under the June
      sunlight. The scent of fruits and flowers was heavy on the air. A
      faint-hearted breeze which scarcely dared to blow came up from the harbour
      now and again, and made the heat just bearable. Mr. William Holmes
      Barndale, of Barndale in the county of Surrey, and King&rsquo;s Bench Walk-,
      Temple, sat in shadow in front of a restaurant with his legs comfortably
      thrust forth and his hat tilted over his eyes. He pulled his tawny beard
      lazily with one hand, and with the other caressed a great tumbler of iced
      beer. He was beautifully happy in his perfect idleness, and a sense was
      upon him of the eternal fitness of things in general. In the absolute
      serenity of his beatitude he fell asleep, with one hand still lazily
      clutching his beard, and the other still lingering lovingly near the great
      tumbler. This was surely not surprising, and on the face of things it
      would not have seemed that there was any reason for blushing at him. Yet a
      young lady, unmistakably English and undeniably pretty, gave a great
      start, beholding him, and blushed celestial rosy red. She was passing
      along the shady side of the square with papa and mamma, and the start and
      the blush came in with some hurried commonplace in answer to a
      commonplace. These things, papa and mamma noted not&mdash;good, easy,
      rosy, wholesome people, who had no great trouble in keeping their heads
      clear of fancies, and were chiefly engaged just then with devices for
      keeping cool.
    </p>
    <p>
      Two minutes later, or thereabouts, came that way a young gentleman of whom
      the pretty young lady seemed a refined and feminine copy, save and except
      that the young lady was dearly and daintily demure, whilst from this youth
      impudence and mischief shone forth as light radiates from a lantern. He,
      pausing before the sleeping Barndale, blushed not, but poked him in the
      ribs with the end of his walking-stick, and regarded him with an eye of
      waggish joy, as who should say that to poke a sleeping man in the ribs was
      a stroke of comic genius whereof the world had never beheld the like. He
      sat on his stick, cocked Mr. Barndale&rsquo;s hat on one side, and awaited that
      gentleman&rsquo;s waking. Mr. Barndale, languidly stretching himself, arose,
      adjusted his hat, took a great drink of iced beer, and, being thereby in
      some degree primed for conversation, spoke.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That you, Jimmy?&rsquo; said Mr. Barndale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Billy, my boy?&rsquo; said the awakener, &lsquo;how are you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Thought you were in Oude, or somewhere,&rsquo; said Mr. Barndale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Been back six months,&rsquo; the other answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Anybody with you here?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the awakener, &lsquo;the Mum, the Pater, and the Kid.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. Barndale did not look like the sort of man to be vastly shocked at
      these terms of irreverence, yet it is a fact that his brown and bearded
      cheeks flushed like any schoolgirl&rsquo;s.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stopping at the Hotel de la Ville,&rsquo; said the awakener, &lsquo;and adoing of the
      Grand Tower, my pippin. I&rsquo;m playing cicerone. Come up and have a smoke and
      a jaw.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Mr. Barndale languidly. Nobody, to look at him now,
      would have guessed how fast his heart beat, and how every nerve in his
      body fluttered. &lsquo;I&rsquo;m at the same place. When did you come?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Three hours ago. We&rsquo;re going on to Constantinople. Boat starts at six.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Barndale placidly. &lsquo;<i>I&rsquo;m</i> going on to Constantinople too.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now that&rsquo;s what I call jolly,&rsquo; said the other. &lsquo;You&rsquo;re going to-night of
      course?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Of course. Nothing to stay here for.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      At the door of the hotel stood Barndale&rsquo;s servant, a sober-looking
      Scotchman dressed in dark tweed.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come with me, Bob,&rsquo; said Barndale as he passed him. &lsquo;See you in the
      coffee-room in five minutes, Jimmy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In his own room Barndale sat down upon the bedside and addressed his
      servant.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have changed my mind about going home. Go to Lloyd&rsquo;s office and take
      places for this evening&rsquo;s boat to Constantinople. Wait a bit. Let me see
      what the fare is. There you are. Pack up and get everything down to the
      boat and wait there until I come.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The man disappeared, and Barndale joined his friend. He had scarce seated
      himself when a feminine rustling was heard outside. The door opened, a
      voice of singular sweetness cried, &lsquo;Jimmy, dear!&rsquo; and a young lady
      entered. It was the young lady who blushed and started when she saw
      Barndale asleep in front of the restaurant. She blushed again, but held
      her hand frankly out to him. He rose and took it with more tenderness than
      he knew of. The eyes of the third person twinkled, and he winked at his
      own reflection in a mirror.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; Barndale said, &lsquo;is not an expected pleasure, and is all the
      greater on that account. By a curious coincidence I find we are travelling
      together to Constantinople.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Her hand still lingered in his whilst he said this, and as he ceased to
      speak he gave it a little farewell pressure. Her sweet hazel eyes quite
      beamed upon him, and she returned the pressure cordially. But she answered
      only&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Papa will be very pleased,&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Isn&rsquo;t it singular,&rsquo; said the guilty Barndale with an air of commonplace
      upon him, &lsquo;that we should all be making this journey together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very singular indeed,&rsquo; said pretty Miss Le-land, with so bright a sparkle
      of mirth in those demure hazel eyes that Barndale, without knowing why,
      felt himself confounded.
    </p>
    <p>
      Mr. James Leland winked once more at his reflection in the mirror, and was
      discovered in the act by Barndale, who became signally disconcerted in
      manner.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Leland relieved his embarrassment by taking away her brother for a
      conference respecting the package of certain treasures purchased a day or
      two before in Venice. The lone one smoked, and lounged, and waited. He
      tried to read, and gave it up. He strayed down to the harbour, and,
      finding his servant solemnly mounting guard over his luggage on board the
      boat, he himself went aboard and in-spected his berth, and chatted with
      the steward, in whom he discovered an old acquaintance.
    </p>
    <p>
      But the time went drearily; and Barndale, who was naturally a man to be
      happy under all sorts of circumstances, suffered all the restlessness,
      chagrin, and envy with which love in certain of its stages has power to
      disturb the spirit. He had made up a most heroic mind on this question of
      Miss Leland some three months ago, and had quite decided that she did not
      care for him. He wasn&rsquo;t going to break his heart for a woman who didn&rsquo;t
      care for him. Not he.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     If she be not fair for me,
     What care I how fair she be?
</pre>
    <p>
      She had made fun of him in her own demure way. He ventured once on a
      little touch of sentiment, which she never neglected to repeat, when
      opportunity offered, in his presence. She repeated it with so serious an
      air, so precisely as if it were an original notion which had just then
      occurred to her, that Barndale winced under it every time she used it. His
      mind was quite made up on this matter. He would go away and forget her. He
      believed she liked him, in a friendly sisterly sort of way, and that made
      him feel more hopeless. There were evidences enough to convince you or me,
      had we been there to watch them, that this young lady was caught in the
      toils of love quite as inextricably as this young gentleman; but, with the
      pigheaded obstinacy and stupidity incident to his condition, he declined
      to see it, and voluntarily betook himself to misery, after the manner of
      young men in love from time immemorial. A maiden who can be caught without
      chasing is pretty generally not worth catching; and cynics have been known
      to say that the pleasure of stalking your bride is perhaps the best part
      of matrimony. This our young Barndale would not have believed. He
      believed, rather, that the tender hopes and chilling fears of love were
      among the chief pains of life, and would have laughed grimly if anyone had
      prophesied that he would ever look back to them with longing regret. We,
      who are wiser, will not commiserate but envy this young gentleman,
      remembering the time when those tender hopes and chilling fears were ours&mdash;when
      we were happier in our miseries than we have now the power to be in our
      joys.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Lelands came at last, and Barndale had got the particular form of
      love&rsquo;s misery which he most coveted. The old gentleman was cordial, the
      old lady was effusive, the awakener was what he had always been, and
      Lilian was what she had always been to Barndale&mdash;a bewildering
      maddening witchery, namely, which set him fairly beside himself. Let it
      not be prejudicial to him in your judgment that you see him for the first
      time under these foolish circumstances. Under other conditions you would
      find much to admire in him. Even now, if you have any taste for live
      statuary, you shall admire this upright six feet two inches of
      finely-modelled bone and muscle. If manly good-nature can make a handsome
      sun-browned face pleasant to you, then shall Barndale&rsquo;s countenance find
      favour in your eyes. Of his manly ways, his good and honest heart, this
      story will tell you something, though perchance not much. If you do not
      like Barndale before you part with him, believe me, it is my fault, who
      tell his story clumsily, and not his. For the lady of his love there might
      be more to say, if I were one of those clever people who read women. As it
      is, you shall make your own reading of her, and shall dislike her on your
      own personal responsibility, or love her for her transparent merits, and
      for the sake of no stupid analysis of mine.
    </p>
    <p>
      Do you know the Adriatic? It pleases me to begin a love story over its
      translucent sapphire and under its heavenly skies. I shall rejoice again
      in its splendours as I hover in fancy over these two impressionable young
      hearts, to whom a new glamour lives upon its beauties.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa and Mamma Leland are placidly asleep on the saloon deck, beneath the
      flapping awning. Leland Junior is carrying on a pronounced flirtation with
      a little Greek girl, and Lilian and Barndale are each enjoying their own
      charming spiritual discomforts. They say little, but, like the famous
      parrot, they think the more. Concerning one thing, however, Mr. Barndale
      thinks long and deeply, pulling his tawny beard meanwhile. Lilian, gazing
      with placid-seeming spirit on the deep, is apparently startled by the
      suddenness of his address.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Leland!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;How you startled me!&rsquo; she answers, turning her hazel eyes upon him. She
      has been waiting these last five minutes for him to speak, and knew that
      he was about it. But take notice that these small deceits in the gentle
      sex are natural, and by no means immoral.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am disturbed in mind,&rsquo; says Barndale, blushing a httle behind his
      bronze, &lsquo;about an incident of yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Conscience,&rsquo; says Lilian, calmly didactic, &lsquo;will assert herself
      occasionally.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Conscience,&rsquo; says Barndale, blushing a httle more perceptibly, &lsquo;has httle
      to do with this disturbance. Why did you laugh when I said that it was
      singular that we should be making this pleasant journey together?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Did I laugh?&rsquo; she asked demurely. Then quite suddenly, and with an air of
      denunciation.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ask James.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale rises obediently.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No, no,&rsquo; says the lady. &lsquo;Sit down, Mr. Barndale. I was only joking. There
      was no reason.&rsquo; And now the young lady is blushing. &lsquo;Did I really laugh?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You smiled,&rsquo; says the guilty Barndale. &lsquo;At what?&rsquo; inquires she with
      innocent inadvertency.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh!&rsquo; cries the young fellow, laughing outright, &lsquo;that is too bad. Why <i>did</i>
      you laugh when I said it was singular?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I am not prepared,&rsquo; she answers, &lsquo;to account for all my smiles of
      yesterday.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then,&rsquo; says Barndale, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll go and ask Jimmy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will do nothing of the kind.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Why?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because you are too polite, Mr. Barndale, to pry into a lady&rsquo;s secrets.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There is a secret here, then?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are contradictory, Miss Leland?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are obtuse, Mr. Barndale. If there be a secret it is as open as&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As what?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As your door was yesterday when you spoke to your servant.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Then you&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; responds Miss Lilian, severely. I know you gentlemen. You were
      going home until you met that idle and dissolute James, by accident. Then
      you suddenly change your mind, and go out to Constantinople.&rsquo; There for a
      moment she pauses and follows up her victory over the now crimson Barndale
      with a terrible whisper. &lsquo;<i>On the spree</i>! Oh, you need scarcely look
      surprised. I have learned your vulgar terms from James.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope I am not so criminal as you fancy,&rsquo; says Barndale, finding the
      proof of his guilt fall less heavily than he had feared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If you were thrice as criminal, this is not the tribunal,&rsquo; and she waves
      her parasol round her feet, &lsquo;at which the felon should be tried.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But, Miss Leland, if it were not because I met your brother that&mdash;I
      came out here! If there were another reason!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;If there were another reason I confess my smile out of time and apologise
      for it.&rsquo; And therewith she shot him through and through with another
      smile. It was fatal to both, for he in falling caught her with him. These
      things have a habit of occurring all at once, and in anything rather than
      the meditated fashion.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lilian,&rsquo; said the young Barndale, inwardly delirious at his own daring
      and the supernal beauty of her smile, but on the outside of him quite calm
      and assured, and a trifle masterful, &lsquo;I came because I learned that you
      were com-ing. If you are displeased with me for that, I will land at Corfu
      and go home. And bury my misery,&rsquo; he added in a tone so hollow and
      sepulchral that you or I had laughed.
    </p>
    <p>
      Miss Leland sat quite grave with downcast eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you displeased?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I have no right to be displeased,&rsquo; she murmured.
    </p>
    <p>
      Of course you and I can see quite clearly that he might have kissed her
      there and then, and settled the business, murmuring &lsquo;Mine own!&rsquo; But he was
      in love, which we are not, and chose to interpret that pretty murmur
      wrongly. So there fell upon the pair an awkward silence. He was the first
      to break it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will land at Corfu,&rsquo; he said, with intense penitence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But not&mdash;not because of my displeasure,&rsquo; she answered; a little too
      gaily for the gaiety to be quite real.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Ah, then!&rsquo; he said, catching at this ark of perfect safety, which looked
      like a straw to his love-blinded eyes, &lsquo;you are not displeased?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; she answered lightly, still playing with him, now she felt so sure
      of him, and inwardly melting and yearning over him; &lsquo;I am not displeased.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;But are you pleased?&rsquo; said he, growing bolder.&rsquo; Are you pleased that I
      came because you came&mdash;because I&mdash;&mdash;&mdash;?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There he paused, and she took a demure look at him. He burst out all at
      once in a whisper&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Because I love you?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She did not answer him; but when next she looked at him he saw that the
      tears had gathered thickly in her lovely eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You are not pained at that,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I have loved you ever since that
      day you were at my place in Surrey, when you came down with Jimmy, and my
      poor old dad was there.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; she said, looking up again, and smiling through the dimness of her
      eyes, &lsquo;I know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      And so it came about that, when Leland Senior awoke, Barndale held a
      conference with him, which terminated in a great shaking of hands. There
      was another conference between Lilian and her mother, which ended, as it
      began, in tears, and kisses, and smiles. Tears, and kisses, and smiles
      made a running accompaniment to that second conference, and tender
      embraces broke in upon it often. It was settled between them all&mdash;papa,
      and mamma, and the lovers&mdash;that they should finish the journey
      together, and that the marriage should be solemnised a year after their
      arrival at home. It goes without saying that Barndale looked on this delay
      with very little approval. But Leland Senior insisted on it stoutly, and
      carried his point. And even in spite of this the young people were
      tolerably happy. They were together a good deal, and, in the particular
      stage at which they had arrived, the mere fact of being together is a
      bliss and a wonder. Leigh Hunt&mdash;less read in these days than he
      deserves to be&mdash;sings truly&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      Heaven&rsquo;s in any roof that covers On any one same night two lovers.
    </p>
    <p>
      They went about in a state of Elysian beatitude, these young people. Love
      worked strange metamorphoses, as he does always. They found new joys in
      Tennyson, and rejoiced in the wonderful colours of the waves. I am not
      laughing at them for these things. I first read Tennyson when I was in
      love, and liked him, and understood him a great deal better than I have
      been able to do since I came out of Love&rsquo;s dear bondages. To be in love is
      a delicious and an altogether admirable thing. I would be in love again
      to-morrow if I could. You should be welcome to your foolish laugh at my
      raptures. Ah me! I shall never know those raptures any more; and the
      follies you will laugh at in me will be less noble, less tender, less
      innocently beautiful than those of young love. But to them, who were so
      sweet to each other, the moonlight was a revelation of marvellous
      sanctity, and the sea was holy by reason of their passionate hearts that
      hallowed it.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER II.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Incidental mention has been made of the fact that Leland Junior engaged in
      a pronounced flirtation with a little Greek girl aboard the vessel wherein
      Barndale made love so stupidly and so successfully. It was out of this
      incident that the strange story which follows arose. It would not have
      been easy to tell that story without relating the episode just concluded;
      and when one has to be tragic it is well to soften the horrors by a little
      love-making, or some other such emollient. I regret to say that the little
      Greek girl&mdash;who was tyrannously pretty by the way&mdash;was as
      thorough-paced a little flirt as ever yet the psychic philosopher
      dissected. She had very large eyes, and very pretty lips, and a very saucy
      manner with a kind of inviting shyness in it. Jimmy Leland&rsquo;s time had not
      yet come, or I know no reason why he should not have succumbed to this
      charming young daughter of Hellas. As it was, he flirted hugely, and cared
      not for her one copper halfpenny. She was a little taken with him, and was
      naturally a little indiscreet. Otherwise surely she would never have
      consented to meet James at the Concordia Garden on the evening of their
      arrival at Constantinople. He had been in Constantinople before, and was
      &lsquo;down to the ropes,&rsquo; as he preferred to say. He made his appointment with
      the young lady and kept it, slipping out from Misserie&rsquo;s, and leaving the
      other members of his party trifling with their dessert at that dreary
      table d&rsquo;hôte, and lost in wonder at the execrable pictures which are
      painted in distemper upon the walls of that dismal salle à manger. He
      strolled down the Grande Rue de Pera, drank a liqueur at Valori&rsquo;s, and
      turned into the Concordia in the summer dusk. He sat down at one of the
      little wooden tables, and aired his Turkish before the waiter by orders
      for vishnap, limoni, and attesh. Then he crossed his legs, lit his cigar,
      and waited and watched for the little Greek lady. The little Greek lady
      came not; but in her stead, as he watched the entrance place, appeared the
      manly form of his chum Barndale, clad in loose white serge. Barndale
      caught sight of Leland almost at the moment of his own entrance, and took
      a seat beside him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lilian has gone to bed,&rsquo; said Barndale, &lsquo;and I came in here by accident.
      Glad I found you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He looked about him with no great interest. The stream of people flowed
      round and round the little circle, and repeated itself once in five
      minutes or thereabouts, until he got to know nearly all the faces in the
      crowd. He noted one face especially, where many were notable.
    </p>
    <p>
      It was the face of a Greek of a very severe and commanding type, shadowed
      in some strange way by a look which made the owner of the face absolutely
      irritating to Barndale. There are some opposites in nature&mdash;human
      nature&mdash;which can only meet to hate each other. These two crossed
      glances once, and each was displeased with what he saw in the other. The
      Greek saw a handsome, good-natured, bronzed face, the thoughtful eyes
      whereof looked at him with an expression of curiosity and analysis. The
      Englishman saw a pair of languid eyes, which flashed instantaneous
      defiance and anger back to scrutiny. The Greek went by, and in his after
      passages looked no more at Barndale, who continued to watch him with an
      unaccountable, disliking regard. The crowd had completed its circle some
      half score of times, and Barndale missed his Greek from it. Turning to
      address Leland, he missed him too. He rose and mingled with the circling
      procession, and listened to the music of the band, and speculated idly on
      the people who surrounded him, as lazy and unoccupied men will at times.
      Suddenly, in the shadow of the projecting orchestra, he caught sight of a
      figure which he fancied was familiar to him. Scarcely had he noticed it
      when it was joined by another figure, recognisable at once even in that
      deep shadow&mdash;Mr. James Leland. And the other personage was of course
      the pretty little Greek girl. &lsquo;No affair of mine,&rsquo; said Barndale, who was
      slow to meddle, even in thought, with other people&rsquo;s doings; &lsquo;but neither
      wise nor right on Jimmy&rsquo;s side,&rsquo; He walked round the little circle
      discontentedly, thinking this matter over with deepening displeasure. When
      he came to the orchestra again the handsome Greek was there, with an
      expression so devilish on his face that Barndale regarded him with
      amazement. Demetri Agryopoulo, salaried hanger-on to the Persian embassy,
      was glaring like a roused wild beast at these two shadowy figures in the
      shadow of the orchestra. The band was crashing away at the overture to
      &lsquo;Tannhäuser,&rsquo; the people were laughing and chattering as they circled, and
      not an eye but Barndale&rsquo;s regarded this drama in the corner. The Greek&rsquo;s
      hand was in his bosom, where it clutched something with an ugly gesture.
      His face was in the sideway glare of the footlights which illumined the
      orchestra. Leland, unconscious of observation, stooped above the girl and
      chatted with her. He had one arm about her waist. She was nestling up to
      him in a trustful sort of way. Barndale&rsquo;s eyes were on the Greek, and
      every muscle in his body was ready for the spring which he knew might have
      to be made at any minute. Leland stooped lower, and kissed the face
      upturned to his. At that second the band gave its final crash, and dead
      silence fell. Out of that dead silence came a shriek of wrath, and hatred,
      and anguish from Demetri Agryopoulo&rsquo;s lips, and he leaped into the shadow
      with a hand upraised, and in the hand a blade that glittered as he raised
      it, One impulse seemed to shoot forth the jealous Greek and his watcher,
      and before Demetri Agryopoulo could form the faintest notion as to how the
      thing had happened, a sudden thunderbolt seemed launched against him, and
      he was lying all abroad with a sprained wrist. The stiletto flew clean
      over the wall, so swift and dexterous was the twist which Barndale gave
      the murderous hand that held it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Get the girl away,&rsquo; said Barndale rapidly to Leland. The crowd gathered
      round, alarmed, curious, eager to observe. Barndale helped the Greek to
      his feet. &lsquo;Are you hurt?&rsquo; he asked. Demetri glared at him, felt his
      sprained right wrist with his left hand, picked up his hat, shook off the
      dust from his disordered clothes, and went his way without a word.
      Barndale went his way also. The band crashed out again, and the crowd once
      more began its circle. When a torpedo is lowered into the sea, the wound
      it makes in the water is soon healed. But the torpedo goes on and explodes
      by-and-by, with terrible likelihood of damage.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale came down heavily on Leland, in the latter&rsquo;s bedroom at the
      hotel, that night.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Jimmy, in sole answer to his friend&rsquo;s remonstrance and blame;
      &lsquo;there&rsquo;s one thing about the matter which may be looked on as a dead
      certainty. The beggar would have had my blood if it hadn&rsquo;t been for you,
      old man. It&rsquo;s only one more good turn out of a million, Billy, but I
      shan&rsquo;t forget it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he arose and shook Barndale&rsquo;s hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What did you do with the girl?&rsquo; asked Barndale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Took her home. The Bloke who had such strong objections to me is her
      sweetheart.
    </p>
    <p>
      He&rsquo;s engaged to her; but she says she hates him, and is afraid of him.
      She&rsquo;ll be more afraid of him now than ever, and with better reason. I
      suppose I shall have to stop here a time, and see that she isn&rsquo;t murdered.
      Suppose I went to that Greek sweep, Billy&mdash;I&rsquo;ve got his address&mdash;and
      explained to him politely that it was all a mistake, and that I&rsquo;m sorry I
      went poaching on his manor, and told him that if he liked to have a pot at
      me he&rsquo;d be quite welcome! D&rsquo;ye think that would be of any use, old man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Leave ill alone!&rsquo; said Barndale, pulling solemnly away at his pipe.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I can&rsquo;t,&rsquo; answered Leland. &lsquo;That cove&rsquo;s likelier to murder her than not,
      if he hasn&rsquo;t got me to murder. Look here, Billy, I&rsquo;ll marry the girl.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Don&rsquo;t be a fool,&rsquo; said Barndale. &lsquo;What do you know about the girl?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Lots,&rsquo; answered the imperturbable James.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Highly connected. Lots of tin. Character irreproachable. That elderly
      Bulgarian party, Kesanlyk Attar of Roses man, knew all about her. The fat
      Bloke aboard the boat. You know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He won&rsquo;t hurt her,&rsquo; said Barndale, thinking of the Greek lover, &lsquo;and
      you&rsquo;re well out of it. Why should you marry the girl? There&rsquo;s nothing
      worse than I know, is there?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;There&rsquo;s nothing at all in it but that confounded meeting at the
      Concordia.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Keep out of the way of the man in future,&rsquo; Barndale counselled his
      friend,&rsquo; and leave him and his ladylove to make this matter up between
      them. That&rsquo;ll all blow over in time.&rsquo; With that he said good-night, and
      rose to go. At the door he turned and asked&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Who is the man?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Leland produced his pocket-book, searched for a page, found it, and handed
      it over to. Barndale. There, in a delicate but tremulous hand, was
      written, &lsquo;Demetri Agryopoulo, Hotel Misserie, Grande Rue de Pera.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;He lives in this house,&rsquo; said Barndale gravely. &lsquo;Lock your door before
      you go to bed.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Leland took his advice.
    </p>
    <p>
      The next morning at table d&rsquo;hôte they met the Greek. He was evidently well
      known at the table, and was popular. His right wrist was bandaged, and in
      answer to many friendly inquiries, he said it had been sprained by a fall.
      He never looked at either Barndale or Leland, but chatted with his friends
      in a free and unembarrassed way which extorted the admiration of the two
      Englishmen, who were both somewhat silent and uncomfortable. But in
      Lilian&rsquo;s society it was not possible for Barndale to be gravely thoughtful
      just now. The business of the day was a trip to the Sweet Waters of
      Europe. Jimmy, who had been caught by that charming title on a former
      visit, proclaimed the show a swindle, and the Sweet Waters a dreary and
      dirty canal; but Lilian and her mother must needs go and see what
      everybody else went to see; and so an open vehicle having with infinitude
      of trouble been procured, and George Stamos, best of dragomans and
      staunchest of campaigning comrades, being engaged, Barndale and Leland
      mounted and rode behind the carriage. Papa Leland, in white serge and a
      big straw hat with a bigger puggaree on it, winked benevolent in the
      dazzling sunlight.&rsquo; The party crawled along the Grande Rue, and once off
      its execrable pavement took the road at a moderately good pace, saw the
      sights, enjoyed the drive, and started for home again, very much
      disappointed with the Sweet Waters, and but poorly impressed with the
      environs of Constantinople on the whole. On the return journey an accident
      happened which sent grief to Barn-dale&rsquo;s soul.
    </p>
    <p>
      Five or six years ago, wandering aimlessly in Venice, Barndale had an
      adventure. He met a sculptor, a young Italian, by name Antoletti, a man of
      astonishing and daring genius. This man was engaged on a work of exquisite
      proportions&mdash;&lsquo;Madeline and Porphyro&rsquo; he called it. He had denied
      himself the very necessaries of life, as genius will, to buy his marble
      and to hire his studio. He had paid a twelvemonth&rsquo;s rent in advance, not
      daring to trust hunger with the money. He lived, poor fellow, by carving
      meerschaum pipes for the trade, but he lived <i>for</i> &lsquo;Madeline and
      Porphyro&rsquo; and his art. It took Barndale a long time to get into this young
      artist&rsquo;s confidence; but he got there at last, and made a bid for
      &lsquo;Madeline and Porphyro,&rsquo; and paid something in advance for it, and had the
      work completed. He sold it to a connoisseur at an amazing profit, handed
      that profit to young Antoletti, and made a man of him. &lsquo;What can I do for
      you?&rsquo; the artist asked him with all his grateful Italian soul on fire, and
      the tears sparkling in his beautiful Italian eyes. Barn-dale hesitated
      awhile: &lsquo;You won&rsquo;t feel hurt,&rsquo; he said at length, &lsquo;if I seem to ask too
      small a thing. I&rsquo;m a great smoker, and I should like a souvenir now I&rsquo;m
      going away. Would you mind carving me a pipe, now? It would be pleasant to
      have a trifle like that turned out by the hands of genius. I should prize
      it more than a statue.&rsquo; &lsquo;Ah!&rsquo; said Antoletti, beaming on him, &lsquo;ah, signor!
      you shall have it. It shall be the last pipe I will ever carve, and I will
      remember you whilst I carve it.&rsquo; So the pipe was carved&mdash;a work of
      exquisitely intricate and delicate art. On the rear of the bowl, in view
      of the smoker, was a female face with a wreath of flowers about the
      forehead, and with flowers and grapes hanging down in graceful
      intermingling with flowing bands of hair. These flowers ran into ragged
      weeds and bedraggled-looking grasses on the other side, and from these
      grinned a death&rsquo;s head. In at the open mouth of the skull and out at the
      eyes, and wrapped in sinuous windings at the base, coiled a snake. The
      pipe was not over large, for all its wealth of ornamentation. Barndale had
      hung over it when he smoked it first with the care of an affectionate
      nurse over a baby. It had rewarded his cares by colouring magnificently
      until it had grown a deep equable ebony everywhere. Not a trace of burn or
      scratch defaced its surface, and no touch of its first beauty was
      destroyed by use. Apart from its memories, Barndale would not have sold
      that pipe except at some astounding figure, which nobody would ever have
      been likely to bid for it. The precious souvenir was in his pocket, snug
      in its case. In an evil hour he drew it out, tenderly filled it and lit
      it. He and Leland were riding at a walk, and there seemed no danger, when
      suddenly his horse shied violently, and with the shock crash went
      Barndale&rsquo;s teeth through the delicate amber, and the precious pipe fell to
      the roadway. Barndale was down in a second, and picked it up in two
      pieces. The stem was broken within an inch of the marvellous bowl. He
      lamented over it with a chastened grief which here and there a smoker and
      an enthusiast will understand. The pathos of the situation may be caviare
      to the general, but the true amateur in pipes will sympathise with him. I
      have an ugly old meerschaum of my own which cheered me through a whole
      campaign, and, poor as I am, I would not part with it or break it for the
      price of this story.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale was displaying his mangled darling to Papa Leland in the salle à
      manger, when Demetri Agryopoulo came in with a friend and went out again
      after a stay of two or three minutes. Barndale did not notice him, but
      Jimmy met him point-blank at the door, and made way for him to pass. The
      two friends crossed over to Stamboul and went to the bazaar with their
      dragoman, and there chaffered with a skilled old Turkish artificer who
      asked just ten times what he meant to take for the job, and finally took
      it at only twice his bottom price. A silver band was all it needed to
      restore it, and it was promised that the work should be done and the pipe
      ready to be called for at noon on the morrow. It chanced that as the
      friends left the bazaar they ran full against their Greek enemy, who
      raised his hat with well-dissembled rage, and stalked on. The Greek by ill
      hap passed the stall of the man to whom the precious pipe had been
      entrusted. Barn-dale had smoked this remarkable pipe that morning in the
      Greek&rsquo;s view in the reading-room, and Demetri knew it again at a glance.
      It lay there on the open stall in its open case. Now Demetri Agryopoulo
      was not a thief, and would have scorned theft under common circumstances.
      But, for revenge, and its sweet sake, there was no baseness to which he
      would not stoop. The stall&rsquo;s phlegmatic proprietor drowsed with the glass
      mouthpiece of his narghilly between his lips. The opposite shops were
      empty. Not a soul observed. Demetri Agryopoulo put forth his hand and
      seized the pipe. The case closed with a little snap, the whole thing went
      like lightning into his breast pocket, and he sauntered on. He had heard
      Barndale&rsquo;s lament to Leland Senior: &lsquo;I wouldn&rsquo;t have done it,&rsquo; said
      Barndale, &lsquo;for a hundred pounds&mdash;for five hundred. It was the most
      valued souvenir I have.&rsquo; So Agryopoulo Bey marched off happy in his
      revengeful mind. There was quite a whirlwind of emotion in the old Turk&rsquo;s
      stall at noon on the following day. The precious wonderful pipe, souvenir
      of dead Antoletti, greatest of modern sculptors, had disappeared, none
      could say whither. The old Turk was had up before the British Consul; but
      his character for honesty, his known wealth, the benevolence of his
      character, his own good honest old face, all pleaded too strongly for him.
      He was ordered to pay the price set on the pipe; but Barndale refused to
      take a price for it, and the old artificer and tradesman thereupon thanked
      him with flowing and beautiful Oriental courtesy. It was settled that the
      pipe had been stolen from the stall by some passer-by, but, as a matter of
      course, no suspicion fell upon the Greek. Why should it?
    </p>
    <p>
      When the time came for the little party to leave Constantinople, and to
      take the boat for Smyrna, Barndale and his friend went first aboard with
      packages of Eastern produce bought for Lilian; and Lilian herself with her
      father and mother followed half-an-hour later, under the care of the
      faithful George, whom I delight to remember. The Greek was aboard when the
      two young Englishmen reached the boat. To their surprise he addressed
      them.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lifting his hat formally he said, in admirable English:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Gentlemen, our quarrel is not over, but it can wait for a little time. We
      shall meet again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      With that he bowed and turned away. Leland ran after him, and, uncovering,
      stood bareheaded before him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I owe you an apology,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I am extremely sorry and very much
      ashamed of my part in the quarrel.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I care little for your shame,&rsquo; said Demetri Agryopoulo, with his voice
      quite low and calm and his eyes ablaze. &lsquo;I do not care about your shame,
      but you shall live to be more sorry than you are.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He went down the ladder by the side of the boat, and was pulled away in a
      caique. As he went he laughed to himself, and pulled out Barndale&rsquo;s pipe&mdash;remembrancer
      of his mean triumph, since repaired by his own hands. He filled and lit
      it, smoking calmly as the sturdy caiquejee pulled him across the Golden
      Horn. Suddenly the caique fouled with another, and there came a volley of
      Turkish oaths and objurgations. The Greek looked up, and saw Miss Leland
      in the other boat. Her eyes were fixed upon him and the pipe. He passed
      his hand lazily over the bowl and took the pipe indolently from his lips,
      and addressed himself to the caiquejee. The boats got clear of each other.
      Lilian, coming aboard the boat, could not get speech with Barndale until
      the steamer was well under way. By then, she had time to think the matter
      over, and had come to the conclusion that she would say nothing about it.
      For, womanlike, she was half jealous of the pipe, and she was altogether
      afraid of two things&mdash;first, that Barndale would leave her to go back
      to Constantinople; and next, that the Greek and he would enter on a deadly
      quarrel. For she had a general belief that all Orientals were
      bloodthirsty. But the meerschaum pipe was not yet done with, and it played
      its part in a tragedy before its tale was fully told.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER III.
    </h2>
    <p>
      The English party reached London in the middle of July, and made haste out
      of it&mdash;Lilian and her elders to peaceful Suffolk, where they had a
      house they visited rarely; and her lover and her brother to Thames Ditton,
      where these two inseparables took a house-boat, aboard which they lived in
      Bohemian and barbaric ease, like rovers of the deep. Here they fished, and
      swam, and boated, and grew daily more and more mahogany coloured beneath
      the glorious summer sun. They cooked their own steaks, and ate with
      ravenous appetites, and enjoyed themselves like the two wholesome young
      giants they were, and grew and waxed in muscle, and appetite, and
      ruddiness until a city clerk had gone wild with envy, beholding them.
      Their demands for beer amazed the landlord of the historic &lsquo;Swan,&rsquo; and
      their absorption of steaks left the village butcher in astonishment.
    </p>
    <p>
      But in the midst of all this a purpose came upon Barndale quite suddenly
      one day as he lay beneath the awning, intent on doing nothing. He had not
      always been a wealthy man. There had been a time when he had had to write
      for a living, or, at least, to eke a not over-plentiful living out. At
      this time his name was known to the editors of most magazines. He had
      written a good deal of graceful verse, and one or two pretty idyllic
      stories, and there were people who looked very hopefully on him as a
      rising light of literature. His sudden accession to wealth had almost
      buried the poor taper of his genius when the hands of Love triumphant took
      it suddenly at the time of that lazy lounge beneath the awning, and gave
      it a chance once more. He was meditating, as lovers will, upon his own
      unworthiness and the all-worthy attributes of the divine Lilian. And it
      came to him to do something&mdash;such as in him lay&mdash;to be more
      worthy of her. &lsquo;I often used to say,&rsquo; he said now within himself, &lsquo;that if
      I had time and money I would try to write a comedy. Well then, here goes.
      Not one of the flimsy Byron or Burnand frivolities, but a comedy with
      heart in it, and motive in it, and honest, patient labour.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      So, all on fire with this laudable ambition, he set to work at once. The
      plot had been laid long since, in the old impecunious hardworking days. He
      revised it now and strengthened it. Day after day the passers by upon the
      silent highway came in sight of this bronzed young giant under his awning,
      with a pipe in his mouth and a vast bottle by his side, and beheld him
      enthusiastically scrawling, or gazing with fixed eye at nothing in
      particular on the other side of the river. Once or twice being caught in
      the act of declaiming fragments of his dialogue, by easy-going scullers
      who pulled silently round the side of the houseboat, he dashed into the
      interior of that aquatic residence with much precipitation. At other times
      his meditations were broken in upon by the cheery invitations and restless
      invasions of a wild tribe of the youth of Twickenham and its neighbourhood
      who had a tent in a field hard by, and whose joy at morning, noon, and
      night, was beer. These savages had an accordion and a penny whistle and
      other instruments of music wherewith to make the night unbearable and the
      day a heavy burden. They were known as &lsquo;The Tribe of the Scorchers,&rsquo; and
      were a happy and a genial people, but their presence was inimical to the
      rising hopes of the drama. Nevertheless, Barndale worked, and the comedy
      grew little by little towards completion. James, outwardly cynical
      regarding it, was inwardly delighted. He believed in Barndale with a full
      and firm conviction; and he used to read his friend&rsquo;s work at night, or
      listen to it when Barndale read, with internal enthusiasm and an exterior
      of coolness. Barndale knew him through and through, and in one scene in
      the comedy had drawn the better part of him to the life. Hearing this
      scene read over, it occurred to the genial youth himself that he would
      like to play the part.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Billy, old man,&rsquo; said he, &lsquo;I think Sir What&rsquo;s-his-name there&rsquo;s about my
      style of man. Before you put that immortal work upon the public stage
      you&rsquo;d better try an amateur performance carefully rehearsed. You play
      George Rondel. I&rsquo;ll play Sir What&rsquo;s-his-name. Easily fill up the other
      characters. Ladies from London. Week&rsquo;s rehearsals. Bring it out at your
      own place at Christmas.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale caught at this idea so eagerly that he sat down that evening and
      wrote to a London manager requesting him to secure the services of three
      famous actresses, whom he named, for the first week of the next year. He
      stipulated also for the presence of a competent stage manager through the
      whole week, and promised instructions with respect to scenery, and so
      forth, later on. In his enthusiasm he drew up a list of critics and
      authors to invite, and he and Leland straightway began to study their
      respective parts. It was getting near the end of August now, and the
      evenings began to close in rapidly. The river was quite deserted as a rule
      by eight o&rsquo;clock, and then the two friends used to rehearse one especial
      scene. There was a quarrel in this scene which, but for the intervening
      hand of the deux ex machinâ, bade fair to be deadly. When, after repeated
      trials, they warmed to their work, and got hold of something like the
      passion of their part, a listener might have acquitted them of all
      play-acting, and broken in himself to prevent bloodshed. For they both
      started from the assumption that the tones of the stage must be gradually
      built up into power from those used in ordinary speech, and so they
      avoided the least taint of staginess, and were on their way to become
      rather better actors than the best we have just now.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leland&rsquo;s temperament was not of a nature to persuade him to perpetual
      effort in any direction; and so, whilst Barndale worked, the other amateur
      relieved vacuity with billiards. It got into a settled habit with him at
      last to leave Barndale nightly at his comedy, and to return to the
      house-boat at an hour little short of midnight. He would find Barndale
      still at work writing by the light of a lamp grown dim with incrustations
      of self-immolated insects. Moths fluttered to this light in incredible
      numbers, and literal thousands of lives were thus sacrificed nightly at
      the drama&rsquo;s shrine. It was nearly midnight, and as black as a wolfs mouth,
      when Leland sculled up from the &lsquo;Swan&rsquo; to spend his last night but one
      aboard the house-boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Billy, old man,&rsquo; he cried, bursting in suddenly; &lsquo;look here! Ain&rsquo;t I in
      for it now? Read this!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He handed to his friend a letter which Barndale read in silence.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is awkward,&rsquo; the latter said after a long, grave pause.
    </p>
    <p>
      Leland sat in constrained solemnity for awhile, but by-and-by a genial
      grin spread over his features, and he chuckled in deep enjoyment.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s a lark for all that, Billy. We shall have the noble Demetri here
      next, I suppose. Let&rsquo;s hire him for the great Christmas show. &ldquo;Signor
      Demetri Agryopoulo will appear in his great stiletto trick, frustrated by
      Billy Barndale, the Bounding Brother of the Bosphorus.&rdquo;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is to be done?&rsquo; said Barndale, ignoring his companion&rsquo;s flippancies.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Leland, sitting down and growing suddenly grave. &lsquo;What&rsquo;s to be
      done? Read the letter out, Billy, and let&rsquo;s consider the thing seriously.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale read aloud.
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;My very dear Friend,&mdash;At what time you was at
     Constantinople, when trouble came, you made promise that you
     would not forget me if my poor Demetri should trouble about
     you. When you last wrote to me this was made again&mdash;the
     promise. My life for not one moment is safe. My aunt is dead
     and my possessions are now mine, but there is no friend in
     all the world. Demetri is mad. Of him I know not when I am
     safe. I fly then to London, where all is safe. But there it
     is not possible that I should be alone.    If there is any
     lady in the circle of your knowledge who would be kind with
     me, and permit that I should live with her, it will have for
     ever my gratitude. I shall go as of old to the Palace Hotel
     at Westminster. Two days beyond this letter I shall be
     there.

     &lsquo;Always your friend,

     &lsquo;Thecla Perzio.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      After the reading of this epistle, the friends sat in silence, regarding
      each other with grave looks. In the silence they could hear the river
      lapping against the bank, and the rustling of the boughs on the roof, and
      the moaning and sighing of the wind. But they could not hear the
      suppressed breathing of Demetri Agryopoulo where he stood knee-deep in
      water below the house-boat window, listening to their talk. Yet there he
      stood, not knowing that he was not on dry land; drunk with rage and
      jealousy; with murder plainly written in his heart and eyes, and all his
      blood on fire. He threw his soul into his ears, and listened.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This letter has been a long time on its way, surely,&rsquo; said Barndale,
      referring to the date. &lsquo;It can&rsquo;t take three weeks to bring a letter from
      Constantinople.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s the envelope?&rsquo; asked. Leland. &lsquo;Look at that, and see what the
      London date is.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The home stamp made it clear that the letter had reached England ten days
      back.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My man brought it down this afternoon, the lazy scamp!&rsquo; said Leland. &lsquo;He
      has never been near those blessed chambers since I left till now. A pile
      of letters came together, but I took no notice.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Listen to me,&rsquo; said Barndale. &lsquo;You have done harm enough in this matter
      already, Jimmy, and you must do no more. You must keep clear of her. I
      will send her down to my sister for a time. Sophy is a good girl, and will
      be glad to have a companion whilst I am away. I will go up to town
      to-morrow and see Miss Perzio. You stay here. I shall either wire to you
      or come back in the evening.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The weather had been hot and clear for weeks together, and the traditions
      of English summer were preparing to enforce themselves by the common
      thunderstorm. The wind moaned in swift and sudden gusts, and the distant
      thunder rumbled threateningly. The listener outside misheard this speech
      thus:
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You will be glad of a companion whilst I am away. I will go up to town
      to-morrow and see Miss Perzio.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He ground his teeth, and clenched his hands, and held himself in resolute
      silence, fighting against the instinct which prompted him to cry aloud and
      dash in upon the two, and either slay them both, or sell his own life,
      then and there. But reflecting on the certainty of defeat, unarmed as he
      was, and dreading to declare himself too soon, and so put his enemy upon
      his guard, he fought the instinct down. Yet so strong was it upon him that
      he knew that sooner or later it would master him. He waded to the shore
      and crept along the field in the thick darkness, groping his way with both
      hands. Turning, he could see the dull gleam of the river, and the
      house-boat bulking black against it. He stood watching, whilst within and
      without the storm swept swiftly up. Dead silence. Then a creeping whisper
      in the grass at his feet and in the trees about him, but no wind. Then the
      slow dropping of heavy rain&mdash;drop, drop, drop&mdash;like blood. Then
      a fierce and sudden howl from the wind, like some hoarse demon&rsquo;s signal,
      and the storm began. But what a puny storm was that which raged outside
      could one have seen the tempest in this murderous soul! Not all the tones
      of great material nature&rsquo;s diapason could find this tortured spirit voice
      enough. Yet to find the very heavens in tune with his mood brought the
      Greek to a still madder ecstasy of passion.
    </p>
    <p>
      At such times the mind, fearful for herself, catches at phrases and
      fancies, as drowning men catch at straws. So now, with terrible
      irrelevance, his mind caught at the simple couplet:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Nenni, nenni, vattienne, non me stà chiù&rsquo; à seccar
     Sta rosa che pretienne non la sto manco à gardar!
</pre>
    <p>
      There was nothing for the mind to hold to except that it was the last song
      the runaway Thecla had sung to him. He did not remember this, and had only
      a half consciousness of the words themselves. But in this mad whirl of the
      spiritual elements the mind was glad to cling to anything, and turned the
      refrain over, and over, and over,
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     Nenni, nenni, vattienne, non me stà chiù&rsquo; à seccar
     Sta rosa che pretienne non la sto manco à gardar!
</pre>
    <p>
      Rain, and wind, and thunder, and Lightning, had their time without and
      within. Peace came to the summer heavens, and the pale stars took the
      brief night with beauty. But to the firmament of his soul no star of peace
      returned. There dwelt night and chaos. If his passion were blind, the
      blindness was wilful. For he saw clearly the end of what he meant to do,
      and chose it. Whatever his love might have been worth, he had been robbed
      of it, and for him life ended there. He was but an automaton of vengeance
      now.
    </p>
    <p>
      So having set resolve before him, and having done with it, he went his
      way. His plan was long since laid, and was simple enough. Demetri
      Agryopoulo was not the man to perplex himself with details until the time
      came for them to be useful. When that time came he could rely upon himself
      for invention. And so his plan was simply to take James Leland alone, and
      then and there to put an end to him. He had taken a room in a river-side
      public-house near Kingston, and thither he walked. He made some grim
      excuse for the lateness of the hour and his bedraggled garments to the
      drowsy ostler who had sat up for him, and calmed the drowsy ostler&rsquo;s
      grumbles by a gift of half-a-crown. Then he drank a glass of neat brandy,
      and went to bed and slept like an innocent child.
    </p>
    <p>
      Next morning he was up early, ate a cheerful breakfast, delighted his host
      with foreign affabilities, paid his bill, and went away by train to
      London. Leaving his luggage in a cloak-room at the station, he took a
      stroll about town, dropping into public-houses here and there, and
      drinking terrible brandy. At home he drank <i>mastica</i> as Englishmen
      drink beer, and brandy was insipid as water to his palate, and had just
      now almost as little effect upon his head. Demetri Agryopoulo had
      discovered the one secret of the true dissembler, that he who controls his
      features controls his mind. A man who can put a smile on his face while
      torments rack him, can thereby calm the torments. The resolute will which
      arrests the facial expression of grief or rage, allays the grief or rage.
      He went about with an aspect of calm insouciance, and therefore with a
      feeling of calm and ease within. Yet he was like one who walks with a
      madman, knowing that if his own courage should for one instant seem to
      waver, the maniac will be upon him. In his journey to town he had been
      alone, and between one station and another he had opened his portmanteau
      and taken therefrom a small breech-loading revolver and a stiletto. He
      laid his hand upon these now and again, and smiled to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      The afternoon grew into evening. He took train to Wimbledon, and thence
      struck across country in the direction of the houseboat. He skirted the
      village with its straggling lights, and made his way across the fields to
      the river side. Nearing the boat cautiously, he ensconced himself in the
      bushes on the bank, and watched and listened. There were two voices
      audible. Barndale and Leland were engaged in serious and indeed in angry
      talk. There was a woman in the question apparently, and it would seem that
      the friends were quarrelling concerning her. But the Greek soon heard
      enough to convince him that this woman was not Thecla Perzio. The voices
      grew louder, and some open breach of the peace seemed imminent. The
      friends were rehearsing their own especial scene in Barndale&rsquo;s comedy.
    </p>
    <p>
      It becomes necessary to this history at this point to set forth the fact
      that one Hodges, resident in the village, had within an hour of this time
      received intelligence of the straying of a cow. This man was a yokel of no
      interest to us, apart from this one episode in his career. He had supplied
      the inmates of the house-boat with new milk and fresh butter from the time
      of their first coming. And it was he who had set afloat a report, not
      unknown at the historic &lsquo;Swan,&rsquo; to the effect that for all so sweet as
      them two young gents did go about wi&rsquo; one another, they was a naggin&rsquo; like
      blazes every night,&rsquo; He came by now, driving his recovered cow before him,
      and passed within a foot of the Greek, who lay as still as death in the
      brushwood. The quarrel, when at its height, ceased suddenly, and the
      voices fell so low that neither Hodges nor the Greek could hear anything
      more than a murmur. The amateurs were criticising the dialogue and its
      rendering over pipes and beer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well,&rsquo; said Hodges, addressing vacancy, &lsquo;if theer ain&rsquo;t murder afore
      long, it <i>is</i> a pity.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then the bovine Hodges went his way. Events supplied him with an
      excitement which lasted him for life; and the younger Hodges who has
      succeeded to his father&rsquo;s cows and remembrances, will not willingly let
      die the story of his progenitor&rsquo;s association with this tragic tale.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greek lay hidden in the bushes, and listened to the soft retreating
      steps in the field and the murmur of voices in the boat. By-and-by the
      door opened, and the friends appeared.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall not come back by the late train now, Jimmy,&rsquo; Barndale said, as he
      placed a small portmanteau in the dingy. &lsquo;You had better come down with me
      to the &ldquo;Swan&rdquo; and scull up again.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;No,&rsquo; said Leland, unconscious of the impending fate, &lsquo;I&rsquo;ll walk down for
      the boat tomorrow. If I get down there to-night I shall stay, and I want
      to write some letters. Goodbye, old fellow. Send us a line in the
      morning.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;All right,&rsquo; said Barndale. &lsquo;Good-bye.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The sculls dipped, and he shot into the darkness. For a few minutes we
      follow Barndale. He pulled down stream rapidly, for the train by which he
      intended to reach town was already nearly due. There was nobody at the
      landing place. He fastened the boat, and seizing his small portmanteau,
      dashed at full speed into the road, ran all the way to the station, and
      threw himself into the train panting, and just in time. At the bottom of
      the station steps he had spilt a countryman, to whom he threw out a
      hurried apology. The countryman was Mr. Hodges.
    </p>
    <p>
      The Greek listened until the measured beat of Barndale&rsquo;s sculls had lost
      itself in silence. Then he crept forward from the bushes, stepped lightly
      to the margin of the stream, laid both hands on a sturdy branch which
      drooped above the house-boat, and swung himself light as a feather to the
      after deck The door of the rear room, which served the inmates as a
      kitchen, was unsecured and open. He passed through, pistol in hand, and
      trod the matted floor stealthily, drawn and guided by the tiny beam of
      light which issued from the interstice between it and the doorway. With
      the motion of the boat the door beat idly and noiselessly to and fro, so
      that the beam was cut off at regular intervals, and at regular intervals
      again shone forth, keeping time with the Greek&rsquo;s noiseless footsteps, and
      his beating heart and his bated breath, and altogether taking to itself
      that importance and force which trifles always have in moments of intense
      passion or suffering. Even yet he would not let the madman within him
      loose. Even yet he would hold him back until he saw the object of his hate
      and rage, and then&mdash;&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      The door swung to and fro gently, and the Greek approached it with his
      hand, when suddenly the unconscious Leland from within banged it to
      noisily and fixed the hasp. Then with one resolute action Demetri threw it
      back and stepped into the doorway, pistol in hand. Leland rose and turned.
      He saw the Greek, and read murder in his face, and dashed himself upon
      him. But the murderous hand was quick and true. One shot rang out, and
      Leland, with outcast arms, fell backwards. The Greek, with a hand on the
      table, looked down upon him. Not a struggle or a groan stirred the prone
      figure. Demetri threw the revolver through the open window, and heard the
      splash with which it fell into the water. He drew the stiletto from his
      bosom, and threw that after it. Then closing the door lightly, and
      stepping still on tiptoe as though he feared to wake that prone figure
      from its awful sleep, he swung himself on shore again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our rustic friend,&rsquo; he said to himself as he stood and looked upon the
      boat, bulking black against the dull gleam of the river, like some uncouth
      animal standing at the bank and peering landward with fiery eyes, our
      rustic friend may not forget his prophecy.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Therewith he went his way again, and the darkness shrouded him.

      What should bring fashion, and wealth, and beauty in one charming person
      up to London from the country at the latter end of August? The town house
      long since dismantled for the grand tour now finished&mdash;the charms of
      the season abandoned for peaceful Suffolk&mdash;why should Lilian care to
      return thus at the fag end of London&rsquo;s feast of folly? Has the bronzed and
      bearded Barndale anything to do with it? Lady Dives Luxor gives a ball;
      and Lady Dives, being Lilian&rsquo;s especial patroness and guardian angel and
      divinity, insists on Lilian being present thereat. This ball is designed
      as the crowning festivity of a brilliant year; and to Lilian, blest with
      youth and beauty and high spirits, and such a splendid lover, shall it not
      be a night to remember until the grey curtain fall on the close of the
      last season, and nothing is any more remembered? But a cloud of sadness
      settles on Lilian&rsquo;s charming face when she misses the bronzed and bearded.
      Lady Dives knows all about the engagement, and is enthusiastic over it;
      and, when Lilian has a second&rsquo;s time to snatch an enquiry concerning the
      absent one, she answers, &lsquo;He has never been near me once. I wrote him a
      special note, and told him you were coming. He will be here.&rsquo; So Lady
      Dives strives to chase the cloud. Barndale does not come, having never, in
      point of fact, received that special note which Lady Dives had despatched
      to him. So the ball is a weariness, and Lilian goes back with mamma to the
      hotel with quite drooping spirits. She makes excuses for the absent
      Barndale, but fancies all manner of things in her feminine fashion,
      preferring to believe in fevers and boat accidents and other horrors
      rather than think that a valet has been lazy or a postman inaccurate.
    </p>
    <p>
      Papa Leland, who is here to take care of his womankind, has ideas of his
      own on some matters.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hang your swell hotels,&rsquo; says Papa Leland; &lsquo;I always stop at the
      Westminster, It&rsquo;s near the House, and quite convenient enough for
      anywhere.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It was thus that Lilian found herself under the same roof with Thecla
      Perzio, who lived there with a sore and frightened heart, waiting for that
      shallow lover who had caught her in love&rsquo;s toils, and broken up her life
      for her, and who now left her poor appeal unanswered.
    </p>
    <p>
      Poor indiscreet little Thecla had a suite of rooms on the first floor, and
      lived alone within them with her Greek maid, and agonised. She was for
      ever peering furtively through the door when any manly step sounded in the
      corridor, but she never saw the form she waited for. But it chanced, the
      morning after the ball, that she opened her door and looked out upon the
      corridor at the sound of Papa Leland&rsquo;s footstep. Papa Leland went by
      briskly; but Lilian caught sight of her and knew her in a moment, and
      stayed to speak. The two girls had been too closely engaged with their
      respective love-makings to form any very close acquaintance with each
      other; but during a week&rsquo;s imprisonment on board ship the friendships of
      women, and especially of young and gentle-hearted women, advance very
      rapidly. They had parted with a great deal of mutual liking, and met again
      now with mutual pleasure. In a minute Lilian was seated in the poor little
      Greek&rsquo;s big and dreary parlour. She was a proud creature was little
      Thecla, and would not chatter with her maid. She had given nobody her
      confidence; and now, having once confessed that she was unhappy, she broke
      out, with her pretty head on Lilian&rsquo;s lap, and had a grand, refreshing,
      honest cry. That over, she set forth her story. She told how Demetri was
      madly, foolishly jealous; how he had tried to murder the gentleman of whom
      he was jealous; and how at last, finding herself alone in the world, and
      being afraid of Demetri, she had sought an asylum in England. She did not
      say of whom Demetri was jealous, and Lilian had not the remotest notion of
      the truth. It very soon came out, however; and then Lihan was sore afraid
      for Thecla Perzio&rsquo;s happiness. She had no great belief in her brother. She
      loved him very much; but she was dimly afraid that James was an
      impracticable and unmarriable man, a person who could set all the wiles
      and all the tenderness of the sex at calm defiance&mdash;a born bachelor.
      And, besides that, being, in spite of her many charms and virtues, an
      Englishwoman, she had a natural and ridiculous objection to the marriage
      of any person whom she valued to any other person of foreign blood,
      excepting in the case of British royalty, in whose foreign matches she
      felt unfeigned delight&mdash;wherefore, Heaven, perchance, knoweth. But
      then Lilian was not a woman of a logical turn of mind; she was
      inconsistent and amiable, as good girls always are; and being strongly
      opposed to marriages of this kind in general, determined to lay herself
      out, heart and soul, for the prosperity of this particular arrangement. So
      she kissed Thecla vivaciously, and went to mamma, and persuaded that
      estimable lady to a visit to Thames Ditton in search of James. Mamma,
      having regard to the missing Barndale, and being in some matronly alarm
      for him, consented, and the two set out together.
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale in the meantime had gone to his own chambers, and had there
      smoked many deliberative and lonely pipes. When he came near to the
      enterprise he had so readily undertaken in his friend&rsquo;s behalf, he began
      to feel signally nervous and uncomfortable about it. Of course he did not
      for one moment think of resigning it; but he was puzzled, and in his
      be-puzzlement retired within himself to concoct a plan of action. Having
      definitely failed in this attempt, he resolved to go off at once without
      preparation, and ask at the hotel for Miss Perzio, and then a round,
      unvarnished tale deliver. This resolution formed, he started at once and
      hurried, lest it should break by the way. Lilian and he were within twenty
      yards of each other, neither of them knowing it, when his cab rushed up to
      the door of the hotel.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilian knew the house-boat and its ways. One of the Amphibia of Ditton
      conveyed the two ladies in a capacious boat to the aquatic residence of
      the two friends. Lilian stepped lightly to the fore deck, and assisted
      mamma from the boat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They are both away,&rsquo; said Lilian, smiling and blushing. &lsquo;And the careless
      creatures have left the doors open. We will wait for them and give them a
      surprise.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The two women, full of fluttering complacency, entered the living room.
      Lilian went first, and fell upon her knees with a sudden shriek, beholding
      the prone figure on the floor; the mother darted to her side, saw and
      partly understood, whipped out a vinaigrette, seized a caraffe of water,
      and applied those innocent restoratives at once. Neither mother nor
      daughter had time to think of anything worse than a fainting fit, until
      Lilian, who had taken her brother&rsquo;s head upon her lap, found blood upon
      her hands. Then she turned white to the very lips, and tore open the blue
      serge coat and waistcoat. The white flannel shirt beneath was caked with
      blood. The two women moaned, but not a finger faltered. They opened the
      shirt tenderly, and there, on the right breast, saw a dull blue stain with
      a crimson thread in the middle of it. A gunshot wound looks to
      unaccustomed eyes altogether too innocent a thing to account for death or
      even for serious danger. But the cold pallor of the face and body, the
      limp and helpless limbs betokened something terrible.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Take his poor head, mamma,&rsquo; cried Lilian; and she darted from the cabin
      to the deck, The boatman was lounging quietly in the boat some thirty
      yards down stream. She called to him aloud&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Go for a doctor. My brother is dying here. Be quick, be quick, be quick!&rsquo; 
      she almost screamed as the man stared at her. Understanding at last, the
      fellow snatched up his sculls and dashed through the water. Lilian flew
      back to her brother; and while the two women, not knowing what to do
      further, sat supporting the helpless head together; a man leapt aboard.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You called for a doctor, madam,&rsquo; he said quietly, &lsquo;I am a surgeon. Permit
      me to assist you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The women made way for him. He was a youngish man, with a sunburnt
      complexion and grey hair, a gentleman beyond denial, and beyond doubt
      self-possessed and accustomed to obedience. They trusted him at once. He
      raised the recumbent figure to a couch, and then looked at the wound. He
      turned over the lappel of the coat and glanced at it. He had a habit of
      speaking to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Pistol shot,&rsquo; he muttered. &lsquo;Close quarters. Coat quite burned. Decimal
      three-fifty or thereabouts I fancy from the look of it. Ah, here it is!
      Have you a penknife or a pair of scissors, madam? That small knife will
      do. Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      A dexterous touch, and from the little gaping lips carved by the
      penknife&rsquo;s point in the muscle of the back rolled out a flattened piece of
      lead with jagged edges like a battered shilling, but a trifle thicker.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said the surgeon, laying it on the table; &lsquo;decimal three-fifty.
      What&rsquo;s this? Wound on the head. Your handkerchief, please. Cold water.
      Thank you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      His busy and practised hands were at work all the while.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Now, ladies, wait here for a few moments. I must bring help.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Stop one minute!&rsquo; cried the mother. &lsquo;Is he in danger?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Grave danger.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will he die?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not if I can help it,&rsquo; And with that the stranger leaped on shore, and
      ran like a racehorse across the fields and into the nearest house, where
      he turned out the residents in a body, and made them unship a five-barred
      gate. There were plenty of cushions in the boat, and he wasted no time in
      getting others. The helpers beaten up by the doctor worked with a will;
      and one ran off in advance and seized upon a punt belonging to the Campers
      Out, and set it at the end of the house-boat, towards the shore. Over this
      they bore Leland, and laid him on the cushions which the doctor had
      arranged upon the gate. Then they carried him into the &lsquo;Swan&rsquo; and got him
      to bed there.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilian and her mother, trembling and struggling with their tears, followed
      the bearers. The crowd which always accompanies disaster, even in a
      village, made its comments as the melancholy little cortege went along,
      and Lilian could not fail to overhear. Hodges was there.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I know&rsquo;d what it ud come to,&rsquo; proclaimed Hodges loudly. &lsquo;They was a
      naggin&rsquo; every night, like mad, they was. I told you all what it ud come
      to.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;So a did,&rsquo; said others in the crowd. Then some one asked &lsquo;Where&rsquo;s t&rsquo;other
      chap?&rsquo; and in the murmur Lilian heard her lover&rsquo;s name again and again
      repeated.
    </p>
    <p>
      She knew well enough&mdash;she could not fail to know&mdash;the meaning of
      the murmurs; but she started as though she had been struck when Hodges
      said aloud, so that all might hear&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;They was a naggin&rsquo; again last night, an&rsquo; then theer was a shot; and then
      ten minutes arterwards that Barndale bolts and knocks me over at the
      bottom o&rsquo; the station steps. What&rsquo;s all that pint to?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh,&rsquo; said another, &lsquo;there can&rsquo;t be no mortal shadder of a doubt who done
      it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      For a moment these cruel words turned her faint; but the swift reaction of
      certainty and resolve which followed them nerved her and braced her for
      all the troublous times to come. She waited calmly until all had been done
      that could be done. Then when the doctor had left his patient, she took
      him apart.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother has been wounded by a pistol shot?&rsquo; she asked him very bravely
      and steadily. The doctor nodded. &lsquo;I must find out who did it,&rsquo; she went
      on, looking him full in the face with her hazel eyes.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The people here seem to suspect a Mr. &mdash;&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      She snatched the word out of the doctor&rsquo;s mouth.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother&rsquo;s dearest friend, sir. Why, sir, they would have died for each
      other.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;As you would for one of them?&rsquo; said the doctor to himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have experience in these matters, sir. Will you help me to examine
      the boat? There may perhaps be something there to help us to track the
      criminal.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor had but the poorest opinion of this scheme. &lsquo;But, yes,&rsquo; he
      said, he would go, and then fell to thinking aloud. &lsquo;Poor thing.
      Wonderfully plucky. Bears it well. Brother half killed. Lover suspected.
      Go! Of course I&rsquo;ll go. Why the devil shouldn&rsquo;t I?&rsquo; And he marched along
      unconscious of his utterances or of the heightened colour and the look of
      momentary surprise in Lilian&rsquo;s face. &lsquo;Pretty girl, too,&rsquo; said the doctor,
      in audible thought. &lsquo;Devilish pretty! Good girl, I should fancy. Like the
      looks of her. Hard lines, poor thing&mdash;hard lines!&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      They reached the bank and walked across the punt into the house-boat. As
      she entered the door Lilian gave a cry, and dashed at the table; then
      turned and held up before the doctor&rsquo;s eyes a meerschaum pipe&mdash;the
      identical Antoletti meerschaum stolen in the Stamboul Bazaar by Demetri
      Agryopoulo.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This is it!&rsquo; she gasped. &lsquo;The clue! Oh, it is certain! It is true! Who
      else could have wished him ill?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Then she told the doctor the story of the pipe. She told her tale in
      verbal lightning. Every sentence flashed forth a fact; and in sixty
      seconds or thereabouts the doctor was a man convinced.
    </p>
    <p>
      But meantime where was Barndale? Poor Leland could tell them nothing. For
      many a day he would bear no questioning. Could her lover, Lilian asked
      herself, have started for the ball last night, and come to any damage by
      the way?
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Here is a letter,&rsquo; said the doctor, quietly taking up something from the
      table. &lsquo;A lady&rsquo;s handwriting. Postmark, Constantinople.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He drew the letter from its envelope and read it as coolly as if he had a
      right to read it.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The story is clear enough,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;The lady is in London. Your brother
      knew of her presence there. The Greek you speak of has followed her. The
      pipe proves his presence here. But how did he find out with whom the lady
      was in correspondence?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That I cannot guess,&rsquo; said Lilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      It had been late in the afternoon when Lilian and her mother reached the
      house-boat first. Twilight had fallen when the doctor and the girl started
      to walk back together. Lilian, turning to look at the house-boat as they
      went, seized the doctor by the shoulder. He turned and looked at her. She
      pointed to a figure in the fields.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The Greek!&rsquo; she whispered.
    </p>
    <p>
      She was right. Demetri Àgryopoulo had come back again with twilight to the
      scene of his crime, drawn by an impulse, passionate, irresistible,
      supreme.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor ran straight for him, leaping the hedge like a deer. Lilian,
      mad with the excitement of the moment, followed she knew not how. Demetri
      Agryopoulo turned and awaited the arrival of these two onward-rushing
      figures calmly. The doctor laid a hand upon him.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I arrest you on a charge of murder,&rsquo; he said, gasping for breath.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Bah!&rsquo; said Demetri Agryopoulo quietly, and threw the doctor&rsquo;s hand aside.
    </p>
    <p>
      The doctor seized him again, but he was spent and breathless. The Greek
      threw him off as if he had been a child.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Are you mad?&rsquo; he asked. &lsquo;What murder? Where? When?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My brother&rsquo;s murder, here, last night,&rsquo; panted Lilian, and flung herself,
      a mouse against a mountain, on the Greek, and grappled with him, and
      actually bore him to the ground. But before the doctor could lend a hand
      to aid her, Demetri was on his feet again, and with one bound sprang into
      a little skiff which lay with its nose upon the bank. He swung one of the
      sculls about his head, and shouted, &lsquo;Stand back!&rsquo; But the doctor watched
      his time, and dashed in upon him, and before he knew it was struggling in
      the water, whilst Demetri in the skiff was a score of yards away tugging
      madly for the farther shore. The doctor scrambled to the bank and ran up
      and down the riverside looking for another boat. But he found none, and
      the Greek was already growing dim in the twilight mist. And again Demetri
      Agryopoulo went his own way, and the darkness shrouded him.

    <h2>
      CHAPTER V.
    </h2>
    <p>
      Thecla Perzio received Barndale with much shyness and embarrassment; and
      he, seeing that she was a good deal afraid of him, plucked up courage and
      treated her rather wilfully. He insisted on her going down to his sister
      at his own house in Surrey and staying there under the old maid&rsquo;s
      chaperonage, at least until such time as she should be able to find
      another suitable companion. The more Thecla found herself overpowered by
      this masterful son of Anak, the more she felt resigned, and comfortable,
      and peaceful, and safe. Barndale, like the coward he was, felt his power
      and took advantage of it. He would have no &lsquo;nay&rsquo; on any grounds, but
      exacted immediate obedience.
    </p>
    <p>
      To make things smoother he set out that afternoon for Surrey, saw his
      sister, talked her into a great state of sympathy for little Thecla, and
      brought her back to town by the next morning&rsquo;s train. Then, having
      introduced the ladies to each other, he left them and went to his own
      chambers in King&rsquo;s Bench Walk. Arrived there he stooped at the keyhole,
      finding some trifle or other there opposing his latch-key. The key-hole
      was half-filled with putty. Barndale never lost his temper. &lsquo;Some genius
      takes this for a joke, I suppose,&rsquo; he murmured philosophically, and
      proceeded by the aid of a pocket corkscrew to clear the keyhole. He had
      just succeeded when a hand was laid familiarly upon his shoulder. He
      turned and saw a stranger clean-shaven, calm, and in aspect business-like.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Barndale, I think?&rsquo; said the familiar stranger.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes,&rsquo; said Barndale, looking down at him in a somewhat stately way, in
      resentment of the familiar hand upon his shoulder.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;We&rsquo;ll do our little bit of business inside, sir, if <i>you</i> please.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale looked at him again inquiringly, opened the door, walked in, and
      allowed the stranger to follow. The man entered the room and stood before
      Barndale on the hearthrug. He had one hand in the breast of his coat; and
      somehow, as Barndale looked at him, he bethought him of the Greek who had
      stood with his hand at his breast in the Concordia Garden glaring at
      Leland.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I hope you&rsquo;ll take it quietly,&rsquo; said the clean-shaven man, &lsquo;but it&rsquo;s got
      to be done, and will be done whether you take it quietly or not. I&rsquo;m an
      officer, and it&rsquo;s my duty to arrest you.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      There passed rapidly through Barndale&rsquo;s mind the remembrance of a disputed
      wine-bill, and the service of some legal document which he had thrown into
      the fire without reading.
    </p>
    <p>
      He connected the clean-shaven stranger with these things, and was tickled
      at the idea of being arrested for some such trifle as a hundred pounds. He
      was so far tickled that he laughed outright.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come,&rsquo; said Barndale, still smiling, &lsquo;this is absurd. I&rsquo;ll give you a
      cheque at once. Are you empowered to give a receipt?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The clean-shaven stranger regarded him with a cool, observant, wary eye.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It&rsquo;s my duty to arrest you,&rsquo; he said again quietly, &lsquo;and I hope you&rsquo;ll
      come quietly and make no fuss about it.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My good man,&rsquo; said Barndale, &lsquo;you can&rsquo;t arrest me if I pay the money.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Come, come, come, sir,&rsquo; said the official, with calm superiority in his
      tone; &lsquo;that&rsquo;s all very well and very pretty, but it&rsquo;s Mr. Leland&rsquo;s affair
      that I want you for, sir.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Mr. Leland&rsquo;s affair?&rsquo; said Barndale.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That little attempted murder the night before last, that&rsquo;s all. Now, take
      it quiet; don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have any nonsense, you know.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The clean-shaven stranger&rsquo;s lips pressed close together with a resolute
      look, and his hand came a little way out of the breast of his coat.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you have the goodness to tell me what you mean?&rsquo; asked Barndale,
      bewildered, and a little angry to find himself so.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Well, if you <i>won&rsquo;t</i> know anything about it, Mr. James Leland was
      found yesterday in a house-boat at Thames Ditton, with a pistol bullet
      into him, and he ain&rsquo;t expected to recover, and that&rsquo;s my business along
      with you, and I&rsquo;ll trouble you to come quiet.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      The tension on the official nerves made hash of the official&rsquo;s English.
      Barndale smote the mantel-piece with his clenched hand.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Great God!&rsquo; he cried. &lsquo;The Greek! Where is Mr. Leland?&rsquo; he asked the
      official eagerly.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;In bed at the &ldquo;Swan,&rdquo; abeing doctored. That&rsquo;s where <i>he</i> is,&rsquo; 
      replied the official curtly. &lsquo;Now, come along, and don&rsquo;t let&rsquo;s have no
      more palaver.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Barndale discerned the nature of the situation, and remained master of
      himself.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I will come with you,&rsquo; he said with grave self-possession. &lsquo;I am somehow
      suspected of having a hand in the attempted murder of my friend. Now, you
      shall arrest me since you must, but you shall not tie the hands of justice
      by preventing me from tracing the criminal. The man who has committed this
      crime is Demetri Agryopoulo, a Greek, attached to the Persian Embassy at
      Constantinople. You look like a shrewd and wary man,&rsquo; Barndale took out
      his cheque-book and wrote a cheque for one hundred pounds. &lsquo;When you have
      done with me, cash that cheque and spend every penny of it, if need be, in
      pursuit of that man. When it is gone come to me for more. When you have
      caught him, come to me for five hundred pounds. Wait a moment.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      He sat down and wrote in a great, broad hand: &lsquo;I promise to pay to Bearer
      the sum of Five Hundred Pounds (500L.) on the arrest of Demetri
      Agryopoulo, attaché to the Persian Embassy at Constantinople__W. Holmes
      Barn-dale.&rsquo; He appended date and place, and handed it to the officer.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Very good, sir,&rsquo; said he, waving the papers to and fro in the air to dry
      the ink, and keeping all the while a wary eye on Barndale. &lsquo;I know that my
      opinion goes for nothing, but if I was a grand jury I should throw out the
      bill, most likely. We&rsquo;ll make it as quiet as we <i>can</i>, sir; but
      there&rsquo;s two of my men outside, and if there should be any need for force
      it&rsquo;ll have to be used, that&rsquo;s all.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I shall go with you quietly,&rsquo; said Barndale. &lsquo;I have two things to
      impress upon you. Let no apparent evidence in any other direction throw
      you off the scent on which I have set you. Next: send a smart man to
      Thames Ditton and let him collect evidence of all the grounds on which I
      am suspected. Now I am ready.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Thus torn with grief for his friend, and sorrow for his lover, but moved
      to no upbraiding of Fate for the cruel trick she had played him, this
      British gentleman surrendered himself to the emissary of Public Gossip and
      went away with him.
    </p>
    <p>
      The officer, having ideas of his own, got into a cab with Barndale and
      drove straight to Scotland Yard. On the way Barndale set out the evidence
      in favour of his own theory of the crime and its motive. Inspector Webb&rsquo;s
      experience of criminals was large; but he had never known a criminal
      conduct himself after Barn-dale&rsquo;s fashion, and was convinced of his
      innocence, and hotly eager to be in pursuit of the Greek. When the cab
      drew up in the Yard a second cab drew up behind it, and from it emerged
      two clean-shaven, quiet-looking men in inconspicuous dresses, whom
      Barndale had seen in King&rsquo;s Bench Walk as he had gone that afternoon to
      his chambers. Scarcely had they alighted when a third cab came up, and
      from it dashed a mahogany-coloured young man with grey hair, and assisted
      a lady to alight. Catching sight of Barndale, the lady ran forward and
      took him by the arm.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Oh, Will,&rsquo; she said, &lsquo;you have heard this dreadful news?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;My poor child!&rsquo; he answered.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This,&rsquo; said Lilian, pointing out her companion, &lsquo;is Dr. Wattiss, who
      saved James&rsquo;s life.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Hundred and Ninety-first Foot,&rsquo; said the medical man. &lsquo;I&rsquo;ve had
      considerable experience in gunshot wounds, and I don&rsquo;t think Mr. Leland&rsquo;s
      case at all desperate, if that&rsquo;s any comfort to anybody,&rsquo; There the doctor
      smiled. &lsquo;You are Mr. Barndale, I presume. Miss Leland has evidence of the
      name and even the whereabouts of the scoundrel who inflicted the wound,
      and we are here to hunt him up.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;May I ask who&rsquo;s the suspected party?&rsquo; asked Inspector Webb with his eye
      on the doctor.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Demetri Agryopoulo,&rsquo; said Lilian, &lsquo;a Greek&mdash;&mdash;&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Attached to the Persian Embassy at Constantinople.&rsquo; said Inspector Webb.
      &lsquo;All right. Come with me, ma&rsquo;am. This way, gentlemen.&rsquo; And the inspector
      marshalled them all upstairs. There he gave a whispered order to an
      officer who lounged to the door, and placed his back against it, and there
      picked his teeth, insouciant. The inspector disappeared. In two minutes he
      was back again.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;This way, ma&rsquo;am. This way, gentlemen,&rsquo; And he ushered all three before
      him up a set of stone stairs, down a set of stone stairs, and into a
      carpeted apartment, where sat a gentleman of military aspect, behind a
      business-looking table overspread with papers.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;You have a statement to make to me, I believe,&rsquo; he said to Lilian with
      grave politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilian told her story without faltering and without superfluous words.
      When she mentioned the pipe Dr. Wattiss drew a packet from his pocket and
      unwound it carefully, and laid the precious meerschaum on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;What is this statement of a nightly quarrel between the two residents in
      the house-boat, Webb?&rsquo; Thus spoke the superior officer behind the business
      table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Man named Hodges, sir,&rsquo; responded the inspector, &lsquo;states that he
      overheard violent rows after dusk.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      In spite of all his grief and anxiety Barn-dale laughed, and was about to
      speak in explanation when Lilian rose and laid a letter on the table.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Will you kindly read that, sir, and then ask Mr. Barndale to explain?&rsquo; 
      she said simply.
    </p>
    <p>
      The military-looking official took the letter and read it through. It ran
      thus:&mdash;
    </p>
<pre xml:space="preserve">
     &lsquo;On the Roaring Deep,

     &lsquo;Thames Ditton.

     &lsquo;Dear Lil,&mdash;

     &lsquo;Billy has struck ile. He&rsquo;s at work on an amazing comedy
     with which he intends to fire the Thames next first of
     April. He and I are both going to appear in it at Barndale
     in the Christmas week. Meantime we rehearse a terrific
     combat nightly.

     &lsquo;While words of learned length and thundering sound Amaze the
     wondering rustics gathered round.

     &lsquo;A genial idiot, Hodges yclept, has persuaded the whole
     village that a murder is on the carpet, and that Billy and I
     are at daggers drawn. Don&rsquo;t tell him this in any of your
     letters. It&rsquo;s a great tribute to our acting that even Hodges
     takes us to be in earnest. I can&rsquo;t call to mind any stage
     row I ever listened to that I shouldn&rsquo;t have spotted the
     hollowness of in a brace of shakes. At this minute Author
     summons Actor to Rehearsal. I close up. This Scrawl to tell
     you I haven&rsquo;t forgotten you. Would have written more, but
     authority&rsquo;s voice is urgent.

     &lsquo;Your affectionate brother,

     &lsquo;J.&rsquo; 
</pre>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I think you had something to say, sir,&rsquo; said the military official
      turning to Barndale, and handing the letter back to Lilian.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;The supposed quarrel between poor Leland and myself is easily explained.
      We were rehearsing for amateur theatricals, almost nightly, in a somewhat
      animated scene, and I can only suppose that we were overheard, and that
      our play was taken for earnest.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Have you any clue to the whereabouts of this Greek?&rsquo; the officer asked
      Lilian. The doctor broke in&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Miss Leland was describing the Greek to me this morning with a view to
      his identification, when a man walked into the room, said he had overheard
      the lady through the open window, and had seen the man she described two
      hours before. He was the boots of an hotel at Kingston. We came here at
      once, after sending an officer to look after him.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;That will do, Mr. Webb,&rsquo; said the superior official. &lsquo;There can be no
      necessity for detaining this gentleman.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilian and the doctor read this last sentence in its most superficial
      light, but Barndale rose and turned with a feeling of vast inward relief&mdash;
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Our bargain holds good still,&rsquo; he said to the inspector, as they went
      downstairs together.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Yes, sir,&rsquo; said the inspector, and bade the trio adieu with great
      politeness.
    </p>
    <p>
      They three took train for Thames Ditton at once, and by the way Barndale
      told the story of his arrest.
    </p>
    <p>
      Arrived at the historic &lsquo;Swan,&rsquo; they settled down to their separate
      avocations&mdash;Lilian and the doctor to nurse Leland, and Barndale to do
      all that in him lay to track the Greek. My story nears its close; and I
      may say at once, without word-spinning, that Demetri Agryopoulo
      disappeared, and was no more heard of. He was too wily to speak the
      English described in the advertisement of his peculiarities. He spoke
      German like an Alsatian, French like a Gascon, and Italian like a
      Piedmontese, and could pass for any one of the three. By what devices he
      held himself in secrecy it matters not here to say. But again, and for the
      last time in this story, he went his way, and the darkness shrouded him.
    </p>
    <p>
      On the day following Barndale&rsquo;s arrest and release, Lilian sat by her
      brother&rsquo;s bedside, when the door of the bedroom opened noiselessly, and
      two women stole in on stealthy tiptoe.
    </p>
    <p>
      One was Barndale&rsquo;s maiden sister, and the other was poor little Thecla
      Perzio.
    </p>
    <p>
      Lilian kissed them both; and Thecla said, in a tearful, frightened
      whisper.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;It is all my wicked, wicked fault. But O mademoiselle, may I not help to
      nurse him?&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;Not mademoiselle, dear&mdash;Lilian!&rsquo; was Lilian&rsquo;s sole answer.
    </p>
    <p>
      So the three women stayed, together with mamma Leland, and nursed the
      invalid in couples. And it came to pass that the indiscreet little Thecla
      won everybody&rsquo;s heart about the place, and that everybody came to be
      assured that no lack of maidenly honour had made her indiscreet, but only
      a very natural, unsuspecting, childlike confidence. It came to pass also
      that when Leland Junior began to get better he saw good and sufficient
      reasons for setting a term to his bachelor existence.
    </p>
    <p>
      And with no great difficulty Thecla Perzio was brought to his opinion.
    </p>
    <p>
      By Christmas time Leland was well and strong again. The chase after the
      Greek was dismissed from the official mind by this time: and Barndale,
      being reminded of Inspector Webb by the receipt of the promissory note for
      five hundred pounds, wrote to that official to offer him a week or two in
      the country. The inspector came, and brought the marvellous pipe with him.
      It had been detained until then to be put in evidence in case of the
      Greek&rsquo;s arrest and trial.
    </p>
    <p>
      The inspector heard the comedy, and told Barndale, later on, that he
      regarded the quarrel scene as a masterpiece of histrionic art.
    </p>
    <p>
      &lsquo;I don&rsquo;t wonder that bumpkin took it all for earnest,&rsquo; he said. &lsquo;I should
      ha&rsquo; done that myself. No, thankee, sir. I don&rsquo;t care about mixing with the
      lords and swells upstairs. I&rsquo;ll have a look in on the butler. Smoking the
      old pipe again, I see, sir. Not many old meerschaums knocking about with a
      tale like that attached to &lsquo;em.&rsquo; 
    </p>
    <p>
      It pleases me to add that Doctor Wattiss officiated at Leland&rsquo;s wedding,
      and married the maiden sister.
    </p>
    <p>

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm&rsquo;s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.
To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
and how your efforts and donations can help, see Sections 3 and 4

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://pglaf.org

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.


Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.


Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
